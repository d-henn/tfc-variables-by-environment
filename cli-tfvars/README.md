## Config

Leverage the built in use of [`<name>.tfvars`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) files.

- [workspaces/**test**.env.tfvars](./workspaces/test.env.tfvars)
- [workspaces/**prod**.env.tfvars](./workspaces/prod.env.tfvars)

## Workspace variable

Modify the workspace to take in the proper `.tfvars` file.

1. Select workspace in question.
2. Navigate to `Variables`.
3. Add / Edit variables under `Environment Variables` section.
  1. Use [`TF_CLI_ARGS_plan`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/environment-variables.html#tf_cli_args-and-tf_cli_args_name) as the key.
  2. Make the value the command line flag used for the cli `-var-file=workspace/test.env.tfvars`.
  
> **Warning:** You cannot use the name `terraform.tfvars` as this is reserved by TFC/TFE and `Terraform Variables` will take precedence over your custom variables should they collide.
